    "> **This step doesn't need to be part of your Minimum Viable Product (MVP), but its highly recommended you complete it, if you have time!**\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT we have a problem - if we calculated a numerical value to encode city (such as the mean of sale prices in that city) on the training data, we can't cross validate \n",
    "- The rows in each validation fold were part of the original calculation of the mean for that city - that means we're leaking information!\n",
    "- While sklearn's built in functions are extremely useful, sometimes it is necessary to do things ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to create two functions to replicate what Gridsearch does under the hood. This is a challenging, real world data problem! To help you out, we've created some psuedocode and docstrings to get you started. \n",

    "**`custom_cross_validation()`**\n",
    "- Should take the training data, and divide it into multiple train/validation splits. \n",
    "- Look into `sklearn.model_selection.KFold` to accomplish this - the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) shows how to split a dataframe and loop through the indexes of your split data. \n",
    "- Within your function, you should compute the city means on the training folds just like you did in Notebook 1 - you may have to re-join the city column to do this - and then join these values to the validation fold\n",

[itertools.product()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) will be helpful for looping through all combinations of hyperparameter values\n",
